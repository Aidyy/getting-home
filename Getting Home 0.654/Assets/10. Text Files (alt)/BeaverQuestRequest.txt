Are you the Beaver?
I certainly am, you’re lucky my schedule isn’t fully brooked.
Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to talk to you.
Can you help me save the Bear Cub? He’s stuck on the other side of the river.
Aw the poor dear is stuck again?
Tell you what, somewhere in this forest is the “PERFECT LOG”!
Get it for me, and I’ll do a dam good job building you a bridge.
