Fox: There you are, Little Thing. What took you so long?
PC: I got lost in the forest…
Fox: Such a strange Little Thing. But here is your exit.
PC: Those are just bushes.
Fox: And a blind Little Thing too? The way out is under the bush; my Foxhole.
PC: A tunnel?
Fox: Indeed. Follow me and try to keep up this time.
