Are you the Beaver?
I certainly am, though I thought no one would recognise me. 
I haven’t moulted yet this season so I’m a bit of a Hairy Beaver...
Can you help me save the Bear Cub? He’s stuck on the other side of the river.
Again? I’d be a very tight Beaver if I refused, wouldn’t I? Be a lamb and fetch me one.
First thing I’ll need is the “PERFECT” log to make a dam. 
It’s been a long time since I’ve had a good log.
