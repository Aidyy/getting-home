Excuse me.
Oh thank goodness you’re home, I was worried sick!
What?
I’m sorry, I thought you were my son. 
He went out to play hours ago and hasn’t come back. What do you want, Dear?
I’m looking for the Hunter, have you seen him?
Well, most of him is back here love.
Can I come in?
Sorry dear, you can’t have any. 
How about this – You find my little boy and you can have the scraps when he’s done? Go on, run along.
