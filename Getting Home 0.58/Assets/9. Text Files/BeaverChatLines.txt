 Can’t wait to get back in the river, this Beaver needs to get Wet.
 Been out of the river too long, turning into a dry Beaver.
 Why haven’t I started moulting yet? I’m such a hairy Beaver.
 Another log WOOD be so good right now.
 Tell you what, I didn’t think this would Bea-very tough, but DAM that wood is so hard.
I bet you’re wondering why I’m not in the river. It was too Mainstream for me, love.
