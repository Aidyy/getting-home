PC: Are you the Beaver?
Beaver: I certainly am, though I thought no one would recognise me. 
Beaver: I haven’t moulted yet this season so I’m a bit of a Hairy Beaver...
PC: Can you help me save the Bear Cub? He’s stuck on the other side of the river.
Beaver: Again? I’d be a very tight Beaver if I refused, wouldn’t I? Be a lamb and fetch me one.
Beaver: First thing I’ll need is the “PERFECT” log to make a dam. 
Beaver: It’s been a long time since I’ve had a good log.
