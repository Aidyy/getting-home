Why hello, what have we here?
...
You're not from around these parts are you, Little Thing?
...  I want to go home.
Home you say? And where is that might I ask?
...
...Well, as it so happens I know a way out of this forest.
You do?
I do. And as you can see, I'm a little… inconvenienced right now.
... 
I have an idea… You get me out of this cage, and I’ll get you out of this forest? Do we have a deal?
Okay.
Excellent. You’ll need to find the key. The Hunter who set this cage left his scent 
... all over the place North of here. Run along now, lost Little Thing.  Set me free.
